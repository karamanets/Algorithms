//ðŸ”¥ Simple Bubble sort Algorithm
//ðŸ”¥ Compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
//ðŸ”¥ The time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, and O(n) in the best case.
//ðŸ”¥ Bubble Sort is not considered a practical sorting algorithm for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.

            if array[j] > array[j+1] {
                //ðŸ“Œ Swap elements if they are in the wrong order
